soln:
; The output of SAT means there is a solution to the puzzle and it is as follows:
; 1.8 cynthia firefox kodak
; 3.2 audrey safari polaroid
; 4.0 kassandra opera canon
; 7.0 adam internet-exp casio

2. Solve the following cryptarithmetic problem using Z3.  Make it give all the solutions.  Each of the letters is a digit from 0 to 9, and no two letters can be the same digit.  Also give a constraint that r > n.  The numbers are written as a human would write them, so they cannot begin with a zero.  As you get additional solutions, make sure you completely rule out the previous solution.
