Two people are guessing the price of a product.  The one who comes closest to the price without going over wins the product.  We need a method to solve this problem.  The method should return the value of the winning guess (for a tie it doesn't matter which it returns).  If both guesses go over, it returns -1. 

The attached file contains a predicate indicating correctness for the problem, and four methods to solve it.  

1. Fill in the predicate to correctly specify the correctness of the methods.

2. State how many paths there are through each of the first three methods.

2. For the first three methods, give values for guess1, guess2, price and r for which it returns the wrong answer.  

4. Bubble up the postcondition for the path taken by the above values.

5. Provide code for the fourth method so it is correct.

Note: There is a place for each of these in the file.  Fill them in in the correct spots and submit your file.
