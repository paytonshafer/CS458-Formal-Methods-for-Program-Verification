For each of the methods in the three files, 
give a precondition (requires), 
a postcondition (ensures) expressing what the method does, 
a loop invariant (invariant) 
and a variant (decreases).  
Dafny will find its own variant, but I want you to still give it explicitly.

For the first two problems, 
show the result of the bubbling up process for all the paths involving the invariant, 
placing it in the comments of the code as shown.
